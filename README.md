# Python-based-framework-for-training-AI-models-using-probabilistic-embeddings-and-pairwise-data
 A sophisticated Python-based framework for training multimodal artificial intelligence models. This system is engineered to learn rich, shared representations between diverse types of data—such as images, text, audio, and source code—by processing them in pairs.
